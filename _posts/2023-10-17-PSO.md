### Description
In a collaborative project with Professor Michal Bildo at Brno University in the Czech Republic, made possible by the [UNIGOU](https://www.incbac.org/) program, I embarked on a journey to explore the world of Nature-Inspired Algorithms. After a thorough review of the literature and gaining insight into some of the principal nature-inspired algorithms, we decided to place a special emphasis on the Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) technique. Our mission was to make PSO accessible to students through an intuitive and educational graphical interface. This platform was thoughtfully designed to empower students to delve into the realms of PSO, allowing them to conduct experiments and make customizations. It leverages the capabilities of PSO to discover minima in three-dimensional functions and tackle the challenging Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
#### What is PSO?
PSO is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the collective behavior of a flock of birds or a school of fish. It's used to find optimal solutions to complex problems by iteratively adjusting a population of potential solutions based on their fitness. PSO can be applied to various domains, including the optimization of mathematical functions and solving combinatorial problems like the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

#### PSO Origin in Nature

PSO draws its inspiration from natural phenomena, particularly the collective behavior of birds and fish. The origins of PSO in nature can be attributed to the following observations:

- **Flocking Behavior of Birds:** PSO is inspired by the way flocks of birds navigate through the sky. Birds in a flock exhibit coordinated movement, adjusting their positions based on the behavior of neighboring birds. This collective behavior helps the flock optimize its path and react to environmental changes.

- **Schooling Behavior of Fish:** Similar to birds, fish in a school demonstrate collective behavior in their underwater journeys. They move as a group, responding to the movements and cues of other fish. This synchronized behavior allows fish to find optimal routes and adapt to changing conditions in their aquatic environment.

PSO leverages these natural phenomena to create an optimization algorithm that harnesses the power of collective intelligence. In PSO, individual solutions, represented as particles, explore a multidimensional search space while adjusting their positions based on the performance of other particles. This mimics the way birds and fish collectively adapt and optimize their trajectories in response to their peers.

The beauty of PSO lies in its ability to translate these natural principles into an effective optimization technique, making it a valuable tool for solving complex problems across various domains.


#### Understanding PSO algorithm
PSO operates on the principles of swarm intelligence, and its key components include:

1. **Particles:** In PSO, each potential solution is represented as a particle in a multidimensional search space. These particles explore the space to find the optimal solution.

2. **Social Influence (Social Weight):** Particles are influenced by the collective knowledge of the swarm. The social influence guides particles toward the global best-known solution.

3. **Cognitive Influence (Cognitive Weight):** Each particle maintains its own historical best-known solution. The cognitive influence guides particles toward their individual best-known solutions.

4. **Inertia Weight (Inertia Factor):** The inertia weight balances the trade-off between global exploration and local exploitation. It helps particles regulate their movement within the search space.

The equations that govern the movement of particles in PSO are as follows:

- **Velocity Update:** The velocity of each particle is updated at each iteration based on its current velocity, cognitive influence, and social influence.
    ```markdown
    v_i(t+1) = w * v_i(t) + c1 * rand1() * (pBest_i - x_i(t)) + c2 * rand2() * (gBest - x_i(t))
    ```
    Where:
    - `v_i(t+1)` is the updated velocity of particle `i` at time `t+1`.
    - `w` is the inertia weight.
    - `v_i(t)` is the current velocity of particle `i` at time `t`.
    - `c1` and `c2` are the cognitive and social influence coefficients, respectively.
    - `rand1()` and `rand2()` are random values between 0 and 1.
    - `pBest_i` is the best-known position of particle `i`.
    - `x_i(t)` is the current position of particle `i` at time `t`.
    - `gBest` is the global best-known position in the swarm.

- **Position Update:** The position of each particle is updated based on its velocity.
    ```markdown
    x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)
    ```
These equations govern the movement of particles within the search space, enabling PSO to search for optimal solutions through collective behavior and iterative adjustments.

#### Educational Interface Development
One of my primary responsibilities during this academic collaboration was to create an educational interface aimed at helping students grasp the concepts of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and its practical application in solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

While implementing the TSP interface, I faced a significant challenge in creating a didactic visualization method for illustrating the TSP problem being solved by PSO. After much exploration, I found that the most effective representation was to showcase the evolving best route as found by the current best particle. The TSP, given its complexity as an optimization problem, presents challenges due its multidimensional representation.

To provide a more didactic approach and address a problem with greater visualization potential, I also designed an interface for locating minimum points within three-dimensional functions using PSO. This interface features a variety of classical optimization functions for straightforward testing and enables users to input their own custom functions for experimentation.
