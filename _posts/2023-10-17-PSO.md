## Academic Cooperation in Nature-Inspired Algorithms
**Organization:** UNIGOU/Brno University, Czech Republic (Remote)
**Duration:** 2023

### Description
During my academic cooperation at Brno University, I had the opportunity to delve into the fascinating world of nature-inspired algorithms. One of the central aspects of my involvement was the exploration of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and its practical applications. Here's a breakdown of my contributions:

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
#### What is PSO?
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the collective behavior of a flock of birds or a school of fish. It's used to find optimal solutions to complex problems by iteratively adjusting a population of potential solutions based on their fitness. PSO can be applied to various domains, including the optimization of mathematical functions and solving combinatorial problems like the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

#### Educational Interface Development
One of my main tasks during this academic cooperation was the development of an educational interface to aid undergraduate and graduate students at Brno University in comprehending PSO and its application in solving the TSP.

For the TSP problem, I utilized Python and the GTK toolkit to create a user-friendly interface. This interface allows students to input TSP instances and observe how PSO evolves over multiple iterations to find an optimal or near-optimal solution. It's an engaging way for students to grasp the principles of PSO and its real-world applications.

#### In-Depth PSO Analysis
In addition to developing the educational interface, I conducted an in-depth analysis of PSO. I explored the impact of parameter variations on its performance and created customized versions of the algorithm to better understand its behavior and capabilities.

#### Literature Review
To gain a comprehensive understanding of nature-inspired optimization algorithms, I performed an extensive literature review. I delved into various algorithms, including PSO, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and others. This allowed me to identify their strengths and weaknesses, facilitating better-informed decisions in choosing the right algorithm for specific optimization tasks.

#### Other Contributions
Besides the TSP-related work, I also developed another educational interface using Python's Tkinter library to find the minimum of functions using PSO. This interface enables students to experiment with PSO in a different context, specifically in the realm of mathematical optimization.
